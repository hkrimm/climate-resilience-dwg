=== Pixalytics

Pixalytics are developing an OGC-compliant API service, see <<Pixalytics_architecture>>, which will provide global information on droughts. The approach is to take global open data/datasets from organizations such as ESA/Copernicus, NASA/NOAA and the WMO and combine meteorology, hydrology, and remote sensing data to produce ARD data based on a composite of different indicators. Where globally calculated drought indicators already exist, these are being used in preference to their re-calculation, although consistency and the presence of uncertainties are also being considered.

Currently, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is being calculated using ERA5 reanalysis data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service. The API access is being set up following the Building Blocks for Climate Services (https://climateintelligence.github.io/smartduck-docs/) approach. Once all steps are working for SPI, the next step is adding soil moisture and vegetation drought indices. Also, work on how to combine indices into a single view/indicator is being considered.

=== Wuhan University (WHU)
Wuhan University (WHU) is a university that plays a significant role in researching and teaching all aspects of surveying and mapping, remote sensing, photogrammetry, and geospatial information sciences in China. In this Climate Resilience Pilot, we will contribute two use-cases: a use-case for drought and wildfire impact, and a use-case for analysis ready data.

=== Ecere Corporation

Ecere is providing a deployment of its GNOSIS Map Server with a focus on a Sentinel-2 Level 2A data cube. _OGC API - Tiles_, _OGC API - Coverages_, _OGC API - Maps_, _OGC API - Discrete Global Grid Systems_, _Common Query Language (CQL2)_, and  _OGC API - Processes - Part 3: Workflows & Chaining_ are the supported standards and extensions for this task.
We plan to use the process output to identify vegetation fuel type, then combine with weather data to assess wildfire hazards risk in Australia.

=== AlpS

The alpS GmbH is an international engineering and consulting firm that supports companies, municipalities, and governments in their sustainable development and in dealing with the consequences, opportunities, and risks of climate change. Over the last 20 years alpS has worked with more than 250 municipalities and industrial partners. alpS accompanied a large number of adaptation cycles from vulnerability assessments to the implementation of adaptation measures and their evaluation. In the context of the pilot alpS aims at evaluating the inventory of methods applied in climate change adaptation workshops. Derived from this evaluation alpS will elaborate a guideline that helps to find a proper workshop-setup. alpS will illustrate the guideline with two to three best practice examples. As far as possible, alpS will test its findings in ongoing consultancies.
